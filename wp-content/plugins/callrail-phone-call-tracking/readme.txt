Dynamically swap CallRail tracking phone numbers based on the visitor's referring source.

== Description ==

CallRail’s software tracks, records, and analyzes phone calls so you can identify the marketing channels that make your phone ring. Our easy-to-install WordPress call tracking plugin allows you to dynamically swap the phone number displayed on your website depending on where the visitor came from.

Each tracking number can be assigned a source (such as Google AdWords, Yahoo Organic, Yelp, Facebook, or another website), and the correct tracking number will display when a user reaches your website via one of those sources.

Then, when a visitor calls your tracking number, we’ll correlate their call with the campaign you’re tracking within your CallRail account. If you’re using keyword level tracking, we’ll send session data back to our server, similar to the data collected in Google Analytics. This gives you the power to see a caller’s activity on your website before, during, and after their call.

>To get started with CallRail’s WordPress plugin, you’ll need an active CallRail account. Plans start at $30 per month, and include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required. [Get started here](http://www.callrail.com/pricing/ "Get started here").
